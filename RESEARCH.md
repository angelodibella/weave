# Ideas to Research

This file contains topics and ideas to research and consider in the implementation of this project.

## Project Structure

- Create headers for commonly used, long data types.
- Modules instead of headers for some cases.

## Matrices

- Stim API instead of Eigen.
    - Higher optimization for specific problems.
    - Would possibly help with implementing $\mod 2$ linear algebra.
- Sparse matrices instead of dense for PCMs.
